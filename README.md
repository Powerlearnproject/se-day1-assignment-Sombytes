Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering principle in the development and maintenance of software systems 
its important in many ways like:
-it has made communication easier as one can communicate to anyone in the world within a blink of an eye.
-it has made learning easier as people can learn anything they want anywhere in the world.Notable example is our humble plp
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.r

The phases of software development life cycle are:
1.Requirements: It's the first stage where users needs are collected and documented.
2. Design: In this stage, the user interface and also the the overall user experience are designed on how it will be implemented.
3.Implementation: This is the code writing stage
Testing: The code will be tested in this stage to check if it meets the quality standards.
4. Deployment: The software will be made available to the end user.
5.Maintenance: Periodic upates for the software.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is the sequential approach with the above phases from top to down while agile methodology is the incremental approach that can respond to changes.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer writes the actual codes to solve real world problems.
Quality assurance engineer ensures that the code is quality as software standards.
Project manager oversees that the overall planning, execution and delivery software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development environment (IDE) provides the software developer an environment for writing, testing and debugging Example vs code .
Version Control System (VCS) provides the tools for tracking changes on source codes.
Example GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The challenges faced by software engineers are:
- Changing requirements
- Tight deadlines
- Technical debt
   Strategies in overcoming them are:
  - Effective communication
  - Agile methodology
  - Prioritisation of tasks
  - Regular reassessment of project goals and deadlines 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the test conducted on individual components of a software 
Integration testing tests interactions between different components of a software 
System testing tests the entire software as a whole 
Acceptance testing tests the user experience of the software 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. 
prompt engineering is the act of crafting questions to get the best response from an Ai.
It helps us in getting the best answer of our question from the AI model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt is "Tell me the history of  an African man"
The improved version of the prompt is "Tell me the history of a black man"
The improved prompt is more effective as it tells the AI what sort of information to specifically look for as not all African men are black
